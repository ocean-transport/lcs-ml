## Identification of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) and applications for machine learning

### Background

The ocean is energetic and turbulent environment with motions 

### Model configuration



### LCS identification method

Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation



### Getting Started

#### Run and/or modify python scripts:

1. Fork the `lcs-ml` repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally using git.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/lcs-ml.git
```
3. Connect to the upstream repository and create a new branch
```bash
cd ocetrac
git remote add upstream git@github.com:ocean-transport/lcs-ml.git
```
4. To fix a bug or add a feature, create your own branch of "main"
```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

5. Set up a conda environment with all the necessary dependencies.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate lcs-ml
```

If you need some help with Git, follow this quick start guide: https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/QuickStart


#### Access to the machine learning dataset

The dataset will be available from Zenodo. It includes a XX-member ensemble of year long simulations with daily potential vorticity fields and a mask for identified Lagrangian Coherent Structures.
